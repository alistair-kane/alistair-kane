### Hi there 👋

* 🌱 I'm Alistair, currently on the search for opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to meaningful projects!

* 💻 Completing the core curriculum at 42 Wolfsburg gives me a solid foundation in C and C++. I have designed and implemented many algorithms with optimization for space and/or time complexity. I love tackling new challenges and delivering pragmatic solutions.

* 🌟 Beyond C and C++, I have expertise in Python through automation projects and in environment isolation through the use of Docker and virtual machines.

* 🚀 I recognise that technology is constantly evolving and believe in continuous learning to deliver the most compatible and efficient solutions.

* 🌍 If you're looking for a dedicated software engineer, I would love to connect with you! Feel free to reach out:
